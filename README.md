# dungeon_delvers

Have you ever wanted to play a command line game that has the fun of a Dungeons and Dragons battle session and the itemization of an ARPG?

Dungeon Delvers aims to bring that to life. Utilizing Python, we can create custom characters that include your standard fantasy species, classes, and more! 

Dungeon Delvers allows you to create an entire Party of up to 4 characters. You're able to save the entire party, as well as save individual characters to then make a custom party later.

Currently, we have the very basics done. The first few levels of a fighter class, basic items equipped, basic combat set against pre stat-ed enemies for testing.

Working on: fully fleshing out classes and their abilities, creating random loot tables, random enemy battles, procedurally generated dungeons, and more!
